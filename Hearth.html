	  <h3>A Cozy Alcove for Student Nurses</h3>
	  <p>Welcome to "Hearth," a cozy corner of the internet where we intertwine the enchanting world of cottagecore with the compassionate art of nursing. Join us as we wander through sun-dappled meadows while we talk about the questions you heart asks that your mind cannot answer. Come have some chamomile tea from the herb gardens and let the warmth of it understand the feeling of confusion you are having in your journey as a student nurse. Together, let us nurture souls through the timeless practices of holistic care. Here, amidst the rustic charm of cottage living, we discover the magic of healing in harmony with nature.</p>
     
	  
	  <h3>Bloom in your own Phase</h3>
	  <p>Nursing is enthralling. Captivating at first, but if you take a look at it a little deeper than usual, you will find reasons you would've never expected to see in your nursing venture.</p>
	  
	  <p>In the first couple of months, you will encounter every single weather in this garden; there will be rain, storms and drought. All the worst weather possible, but, in order for flowers to bloom, it will need water, sun and anything possible to live. Some days, you will feel strange; maybe a little bit left out or a little bit lost yet superior days will visit you soon enough when you get the hang of it. You must trust the path you are taking as well as yourself. In order to survive, accept every weather and go right through it. Until then, know what phase you are in and do not hurry. Let all go in your own phase.</p>
	 
	  <h3>Handcrafted Care</h3>
	  <p>A gentle hand can thaw a frozen heart. The care you tend to give will always have an impact to the person receiving it. So, craft it with empathy and love. You are not just someone who give out medicines or someone who take vital signs, you are someone that has a power to let someone feel safe and secured. So the next time you encounter your patient, let them feel that hancrafted care.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Embracing Seasons of Change</h3>
	  <p>In our cottagecore world, we celebrate the ever-changing seasons as nature's gentle reminders of the cyclical nature of life and healing. With each shift in the weather, we adapt our practices to align with the rhythms of the natural world. In the spring, we plant seeds of hope and renewal, nurturing new life and growth to our patients. In the summer, we bask in the warmth of the sun, embracing the joy and abundance that surrounds us. In the autumn, we gather the harvest and prepare for the coming winter, reflecting on the blessings of the past year and being grsteful for successfully going through every flower that have died and the ones that had grown. And in the winter, we huddle around the hearth, finding comfort and solace in the quiet beauty of the snow-covered landscape accepting every snowflakes that fall and the cold embracing them. Seasons vary, seasons change, and you must be ready in each one of them. A leaf may leave its tree and fall in the cold but a flower may also sprout in the sunshine. Brace yourself to every life you will encounter and welcome them with warmth.</p>
	  
	  <h3>The Garden</h3>
	  <p>At the heart of our garden, nursing practice lies a deep sense of community and connection. We gather around the the garden with our fellow caregivers, sharing stories, laughter, and homemade meals. We support one another through the challenges and triumphs of nursing life, offering a shoulder to lean on and a hand to hold. Together, we create a nurturing ecosystem where compassion flourishes and every individual is valued and respected. You will encounter different kinds of people so if you ever find your people, keep them. 
	 	 These butterflies will bring you light amidst darkness, they will acompany you in every change of season and will always give you a reason to continue and succeed until the end of time.</p>
